## Instructions:

1. Open a Graphviz Editor: https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/
2. The dot syntax in the file [bst.dot](https://github.com/chill-chin/4883-Software-Tools/blob/main/Assignments/A01/bst.dot) needs to be copied into the Graphviz Editor
3. The visual output from the code execution should be identical to the output in the file [bst.png](https://github.com/chill-chin/4883-Software-Tools/blob/main/A01/bst.png)
