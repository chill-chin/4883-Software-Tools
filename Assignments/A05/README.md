## A05 - Family Tree via Graphviz
### Chintan Mehta

### Description:
The following assignment involves creating a graph of family trees. The data from a given file is cleaned and a new family tree data file is generated using python script. Another python file is used to create a .dot file which generates the desired Family Tree.

| :---: | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
|   1   | [helper.py](https://github.com/chill-chin/4883-Software-Tools/blob/main/Assignments/A05/helper.py)  | Python script that helps cleaning the file 'dwarf_family_tree.csv' |
|   2   | [main.py](https://github.com/chill-chin/4883-Software-Tools/blob/main/Assignments/A05/main.py)    | Executes [helper.py](https://github.com/chill-chin/4883-Software-Tools/blob/main/Assignments/A05/helper.py) and converts graphviz code to a .dot file |
|   3   | [family_tree_data.csv](https://github.com/chill-chin/4883-Software-Tools/blob/main/Assignments/A05/family_tree_data.csv) | Use this file if the [helper.py](https://github.com/chill-chin/4883-Software-Tools/blob/main/Assignments/A05/helper.py) file does not execute for any reason |
|   4   | [family_tree.dot](https://github.com/chill-chin/4883-Software-Tools/blob/main/Assignments/A05/family_tree.dot) | Graphviz code that produces Family Tree vizualization  |
|   5   | [dwarf_family_tree.csv](https://github.com/chill-chin/4883-Software-Tools/blob/main/Assignments/A05/dwarf_family_tree.csv)  | Data provided in the Assignment description    |
|   6   | [mexican_names.csv](https://github.com/chill-chin/4883-Software-Tools/blob/main/Assignments/A05/mexican_names.csv)      | Data generated using ChatGPT   |
|   7   | [family_tree.png](https://github.com/chill-chin/4883-Software-Tools/blob/main/Assignments/A05/family_tree.png) | Image Output Binary Search Tree in png format |

### Declaration:
-> ChatGPT was used to generate parts of [main.py](https://github.com/chill-chin/4883-Software-Tools/blob/main/Assignments/A05/main.py) file and all of the [mexican_names.csv](https://github.com/chill-chin/4883-Software-Tools/blob/main/Assignments/A05/mexican_names.csv) file.

### Instructions:
1. Download 4 Files: [helper.py](https://github.com/chill-chin/4883-Software-Tools/blob/main/Assignments/A05/helper.py), [main.py](https://github.com/chill-chin/4883-Software-Tools/blob/main/Assignments/A05/main.py), [dwarf_family_tree.csv](https://github.com/chill-chin/4883-Software-Tools/blob/main/Assignments/A05/dwarf_family_tree.csv), [mexican_names.csv](https://github.com/chill-chin/4883-Software-Tools/blob/main/Assignments/A05/mexican_names.csv).
2. Run the [main.py](https://github.com/chill-chin/4883-Software-Tools/blob/main/Assignments/A05/main.py) file with other files present in the same folder.
3. Copy the contents of the generated '[family_tree.dot](https://github.com/chill-chin/4883-Software-Tools/blob/main/Assignments/A05/family_tree.dot)' file in a [Graphviz Editor](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/).
4. The resulting family tree should be identical to [family_tree.png](https://github.com/chill-chin/4883-Software-Tools/blob/main/Assignments/A05/family_tree.png).
