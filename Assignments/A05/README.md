## A05 - Family Tree via Graphviz
### Chintan Mehta

### Description:
The following assignment involves creating a graph of family trees. The data from a given file is cleaned and a new family tree data file is generated using python script. Another python file is used to create a .dot file which generates the desired Family Tree.

### Files:

|   #   | File     | Description                                      |
| :---: | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
|   1   | [helper.py]()  | Python script that helps cleaning the file 'dwarf_family_tree.csv' |
|   2   | [main.py]()    | Executes [helper.py]() and converts graphviz code to a .dot file |
|   3   | [family_tree_data.py]() | Run this file if the [helper.py]() file does not execute for any reason |
|   4   | [family_tree.dot]() | Graphviz code that produces Family Tree vizualization  |
|   5   | [dwarf_family_tree.csv]()  | Data provided in the Assignment description    |
|   6   | [mexican_names.csv]()      | Data generated using ChatGPT   |
|   7   | [family_tree.png]() | Image Output Binary Search Tree in png format |

### Declaration:
-> ChatGPT was used to generate parts of [main.py]() file and all of the [mexican_names.csv]() file.

### Instructions:
1. Download Files: [helper.py](), [main.py](), [dwarf_family_tree.csv](), [mexican_names.csv]().
2. Run the main.py file with other files present in the same folder.
3. Copy the contents of the generated '[family_tree.dot]()' file in a [Graphviz Editor](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/).
4. The resulting family tree should be identical to the image below:
